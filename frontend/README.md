# Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind)

Quick scaffold for a React app using Vite and Tailwind CSS.

Getting started:

1. From the `frontend` folder, install dependencies:

```bash
cd "d:/job portal/frontend"
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

Notes:

- Tailwind is configured via `tailwind.config.cjs` and `postcss.config.cjs`.
- The app entry is `src/main.jsx` and the root component is `src/App.jsx`.
